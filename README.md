# CeaserCipher
BACKGROUND TO GAIN A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THIS CODE. 

The Caesar cipher is one of the earliest on record. It is credited to Julius Caesar, who used it to send secret messages to his armies. The Caesar cipher shifts each letter of the plaintext by an amount specified by the key. For example, if the key is 3, each letter is shifted by 3 places to the right.

DISCLAIMER
Here are a few things to think about....
1. What if someone inputs a shift number that is too large? e.g 76
2. How can you shorten the code to make it more readable? Some sections are repetitive
